# Overview

As a software engineer, I am continually seeking opportunities to apply and deepen my understanding of programming concepts. This project is an opportunity to work with C#, one of the most popular languages for building robust applications. The goal is to develop a library catalog system where users can interact with a collection of books, borrowing and returning them, adding new titles, and saving data to a file.

The software I developed is a command-line application that allows users to manage a virtual library catalog. Using C#, I implemented object-oriented principles such as classes and inheritance to structure the system, including functionality for reading from and writing to a file. The system mimics a real-world library by allowing users to view available books, borrow them, return them, and add new books to the catalog.

By writing this software, I am deepening my knowledge of C# language syntax, object-oriented design patterns, file handling, and user interaction through the console. These skills are crucial for building more complex applications in the future.

# Development Environment

The project was developed using the following tools:

- **Programming Language**: C#
- **Development Environment**: Visual Studio Code
- **Libraries**: .NET Core for building the application
- **Version Control**: Git for version control, using GitHub for repository hosting

The program uses C# to implement the logic, while the file handling features are enabled by the .NET System.IO namespace. This project runs in the .NET Core environment, ensuring cross-platform compatibility and leveraging modern C# features.

# Useful Websites

Here are some helpful resources I used during the development process:

- [C# Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/)
- [Microsoft Docs - File I/O in C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/io/)

# Future Work

In the future, I plan to improve and extend the application with the following features:

- **Add User Authentication**: Implement a system for users to log in and maintain their own borrowing history.
- **Create a GUI**: Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience.
- **Advanced Search Features**: Allow users to search for books by multiple criteria (e.g., author, title, ISBN).
- **Database Integration**: Transition from file-based storage to a database for better scalability and performance.
- **Error Handling Improvements**: Enhance error handling and validation for better user experience.
  
These improvements will help to make the application more robust, user-friendly, and suitable for larger-scale use.
